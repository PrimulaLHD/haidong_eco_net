"... It is interesting to contemplate an entangled bank, clothed with many plants of many kinds, 
with birds singing on the bushes, with various insects flitting about, and with worms crawling 
through the damp earth, and to reflect that these elaborately constructed forms, 
so different from each other, and dependent on each other in so complex a manner, 
have all been produced by laws acting around us."
