My name is Hai-Dong Li, Associate Professor at KIB, I am interested in understanding any type of biotic interactions 
in our changing world.      

How the biodiversity shaped on Earth? Darwin had stated that the evolution of biodiversity 
on earth involved two aspects: species diversity and the interactions diversity. 
But how inter-specific interactions shaped the biodiversity?
