- **Ecological network vary across time and space**      

- **Metacommunity Ecology**     

- **Development methods to understand ecological networks and community dynamics**            
We are also interested in developing methods, particularly approaches for 
understanding ecological networks and community dynamics. Such as:   

-- We developed a species-patch network framework to explore the temporal dynamics 
of metacommunities

-- I developed an [R package](https://github.com/PrimulaLHD/BiMultiNetPlot) for 
visualizing ecological multilayer networks.
