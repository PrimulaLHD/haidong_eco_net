- **Ecological network vary across time and space**      
My research explores the dynamic changes of ecological networks in space and time and 
its impact on biodiversity and ecosystem function. Using pollination and seed dispersal 
networks as model systems, I am committed to analyzing how ecological networks
respond to natural environmental gradients (e.g., altitude, habitat diversity) 
and human-driven environmental changes (e.g., forest fragmentation and climate change), 
and to deeply examine the temporal dynamics of ecological networks (e.g., seasonal dynamics). 
My research objective is to reveal the relationship between ecological network 
structure and function, and their response mechanisms to environmental change,
thereby providing a theoretical foundation for biodiversity conservation and 
sustainable ecosystem management.  

- **Metacommunity Ecology**     
My second research objective focuses on the spatiotemporal dynamics of metacommunities 
and the mechanisms that govern their assembly, dynamics, and maintenance. 
I explore these questions by integrating metacommunity ecology theory with 
ecological network approaches, seeking to link community structure, dynamics,
and stability to critical ecological functions at the metacommunity scale.


- **Development of methods to understand ecological networks and community dynamics**            
I am also interested in developing methods, particularly approaches for 
understanding ecological networks and community dynamics. Such as:   

-- We developed a [species-patch network framework](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ele.14243) 
to explore the temporal dynamics 
of metacommunities

-- We developed an R [package](https://github.com/PrimulaLHD/BiMultiNetPlot) for 
visualizing ecological multilayer networks.
